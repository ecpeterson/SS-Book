\chapter{The Adams spectral sequence}

Connection to simplicial objects.

Hill has homework assignments posted at \url{http://people.virginia.edu/~mah7cd/Math885/Homework5.pdf} and \url{http://people.virginia.edu/~mah7cd/Math885/Homework6.pdf}, which can probably be used for more examples.

\section{$\pi_* ko^\wedge_2$}

$\pi_* ko^\wedge_{2}$ from $\Ext_{\A(1)}(k, k)$.  This uses $H^*(ko) = A // A(1)$, then a change-of-rings theorem to swap $\Ext_{\A}(\A // \A(1), k)$ for $\Ext_{\A(1)}(k, k)$.  See the tail of \url{http://www.math.ku.dk/~jg/students/masulli.msproject.2011.pdf}, and also Hill's notes at \url{http://people.virginia.edu/~mah7cd/Math885.html} and specifically \url{http://people.virginia.edu/~mah7cd/Math885/Lecture14.pdf}.  The only possible place for a differential is on the guy in $(1, 1)$, called $h_1$, which has the potential to hit a guy in the tower to his left.  This has a cute argument for nonexistence: calling the guy at the bottom of the tower $h_0$, we have $d(h_1) = k h_0^n$ for some $k$ and $n$, so $d(h_0 h_1) = 0 * h_1 + h_0 * k h_0^n$, but $h_0 h_1 = 0$ so $d(h_0 h_1) = 0$ so $k = 0$.  Cuuuute!

\section{$\pi_* ku^\wedge_2$}

This is somehow the same story as $\pi_* ko$, but with an extra layer superimposed?  I very barely remember this...

\section{$ko^* M(2)$}

The ASS over $\A(1)$ for the mod $2$ Moore spectrum is computed at \url{http://people.virginia.edu/~mah7cd/Math885/ExtComps.pdf}; this gives $ko^* M(2)$

\section{Massey products and secondary operations}

\section{Change of rings}

\section{$\pi_* tmf$}

\section{$\pi_{* \le 16} S$}

Hill has lecture notes covering the structure and differentials in the mod 2 Adams spectral sequence through dimension 16 (see Lecture 17).  This is presumably accomplishable by considering just bits of the Steenrod algebra... but I haven't looked.
