The May / Bockstein spectral sequences.  This seems hard to produce a good example of, since it mostly organizes computation rather than easing it in any particular way, but maybe it's worth it anyhow.  The organization is pretty cool.
The tangent spectral sequence: formal groups and tangent spaces, $H^*(F; TG) \Rightarrow H^*(F; G)$
Homotopy spectral sequences of spaces (details with $\pi_0$ and $\pi_1$, see Homotopy limits, completions, and localizations by Bousfield and Kan)
Unbased spectral sequences (choose basepoints iteratively, kind of. See Bousfield's Homotopy spectral sequences and obstructions, which does this for unbased cosimplicial spaces.)
Dan Dugger has a paper titled Multiplicative structures on homotopy spectral sequences. Could be worth looking at.
